# Tango v10 Design Doc

This project is intended to define a design document for Tango v10. In this document Tango Kernel API must be defined in a very precise manner. For this Java interface notation is used to define API of each component of the Tango kernel (Client + Server). The end document must be as specific as possible, i.e. even each component must be very well defined e.g. event system or polling components must present its own structure.

So in the end this document can be used as a refenrence API documentation and kernel developers guide.
