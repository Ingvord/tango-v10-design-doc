> **ATTENTION**: this repository has been archivied. This is due to discussion of the Tango V10 design doc (this repo) that took place at [Tango Kernel meeting in Solaris, 2019](https://github.com/tango-controls/tango-kernel-followup/blob/master/2019-02-04/outcomes.md). The decision was to start Tango RFC initiative to specify Tango Controls V9 and V10 partially based on this document. The repository for Tango RFC project is [here](https://github.com/tango-controls/rfc)

# Tango v10 Design Doc

This project is intended to define a design document for Tango v10. In this document Tango Kernel API must be defined in a very precise manner. For this Java interface notation is used to define API of each component of the Tango kernel (Client + Server). The end document must be as specific as possible, i.e. even each component must be very well defined e.g. event system or polling components must present its own structure.

So in the end this document can be used as a refenrence API documentation and kernel developers guide.
