# Terminology and definitions

To make our further discussions productive, we would like to define the key words from our point of view and show how we understand them. 

If we look through the concepts of Tango we will probably draw the following scheme (taken from Project Tango-Python at LIONS, iramis - CEA):

Each block is opened up as following:
