### Performance


We must also test what developers of device servers write.

- Resource utilization (the library itself should not take much)

**Conclusions**

Currently there are no benchmark tests, no publicly available results. Without it there is no reliable source based on which any assumptions about performance can be done. Some use cases must be covered by benchmark tests on a regular basis i.e. integrated in continuous integration.
