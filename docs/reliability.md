### Reliability in Tango

Tango is a framework used in critical environments (non stop operations, minimal downtime etc) therefore Tango kernel must foreseen errors, faults etc

- Fault tolerance (the system should recover itself)
- Recoverability (...)


The most important feature of availability must be fault tolerance as Tango performs in critical environments. Fault tolerance provides several important features that must be foreseen in Tango:

1) self recoverage

2) self monitoring

3) minimal downtime
