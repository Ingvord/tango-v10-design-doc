### Extendability in Tango

It is impossible to extend current core library with a custom functionality. Tango may be extended via introduction of new Tango device servers, that may enrich Tango functionality (which is sometimes not so efficient nor enough).

**Conclusions**

Extendability of the core library must be designed from scratch.
